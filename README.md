This is a project to create a product for a restaurant management system for a company.

Goals

We need to produce some software that reduces the need for hiring and training waiting staff while
not reducing the level of customer care and attention that is a core part of Oaxaca’s competitive
advantage. 

This means that the software that we create needs to provide:
	
	* a fast, intuitive UI that someone doesn’t need to be trained to use.
	
	* accurate and complete data about relevant parts of the restaurant (no one will be happy if their
		orders are “lost”).
	
	* a secure (but not cumbersome) authentication system that prevents bad actors from capturing any
		customer data and tampering with restaurant data.
